# Introduction to R and RStudio

This is a good two hour introductory workshop that can be taught as a standalone workshop, but doesn't quite fit in with the format of the DRI. It could use a little refinement that I'll detail at the end.  

## Credits
This workshop was written by [Connor French](https://github.com/connor-french).  

## Workshops 
It was first taught at CUNY GC by Connor French in Fall 2020 as a two hour online synchronous workshop. 

Abstract: 

> R is a versatile programming language, best suited for a variety of data science needs. 
> Whether you need to run some statistical analyses, create publication-worthy data visualizations, or even publish a website, R has a multitude of tools to help you get what you need done. 
> This workshop is intended to get interested users up to speed with the R language and the RStudio interactive developing environment. 
> By the end, you'll be able to install and load packages, read in data, do basic data wrangling and visualization, and navigate the RStudio environment. 

## Requirements

* There are no requirements, other than a computer with a stable internet connection. This workshop is hosted on RStudio Cloud, so participants don't need to download R or RStudio.  

## Reception and feedback

Feedback was very positive. The participants really liked the code-through approach. They also appreciated the pace. One good suggestion was to add a glossary.  

## Needed/Desired Changes
It needs a glossary. Also, I think a short overview or link to a tutorial for installing R/RStudio would be helpful to provide participants for them to use on their own time.  

## Instructor notes
I first did the presentation up to the "Time to Get Familiar with RStudio!" slide. I returned to the slides after finishing the coding. I've included the slides as a pdf, but I also added the google slides version to the `R_RUG/workshop_materials` folder of the Digital Fellows Google Drive as an editable version. Before doing the code-through, I went through the `r_basics.r` script with them and gave a crash course on R basics. Then, I walked through the `code-through-bare.R` script with them. I had the `code-through-full.html` file open in a separate window to use as a reference. However, it has too much text to use as a reference. I let them know that it's a resource for when they want to work through the workshop again, though. In the bare script, I use tags like "C1", "C2", etc. to use as reference points.  

Here's the recording if you want to see how I conducted the workshop [here](https://vimeo.com/463469574).  

Here are the pdf slides [here](intro_to_r.pdf). Make sure to update the pdf version for future workshops as well.
